# Broad on purpose: this is a single-tenant assistant embedded on
# EduTrellis's own site, so any message shaped like a request for contact,
# pricing, or company details is implicitly about EduTrellis — there's no
# other company it could reasonably mean. Over-triggering here just adds
# harmless supplementary grounding (the model is told elsewhere to use it
# only where relevant); under-triggering is what let a typo'd or oddly-
# phrased question like "sales number" or "company address" fall through
# to the model with no grounding at all, which is how it ended up
# fabricating a fake US toll-free line and a fake email in the first place
# (see the KnowledgeEntry that got cleaned up alongside this fix).

PUBLIC_SITE_CONTEXT = f"""VERIFIED EDUTRELLIS PUBLIC WEBSITE DATA (authoritative):
Use only these details for EduTrellis company answers. Never invent a phone
number, email, address, price, person, statistic, social handle, or URL. In
particular, there is exactly ONE phone/WhatsApp number and ONE general
support email below — never invent a separate "sales line", toll-free
number, international line, or second email address; if asked for a sales
number/email specifically, the same contact below IS the right one to give.
If a requested detail is genuinely absent from this context, say so plainly
and point to edutrellis.in or {business_info.EMAIL_SUPPORT} — never make up
a plausible-sounding placeholder instead.
