"""Single source of truth for EduTrellis's real, verified contact details.

Every place that shows or tells a user this information — the AI chat
system prompt, company_knowledge's grounding context, and the public
site's contact cards/footers (via the `business_info` context processor,
see edutrellis/settings.py) — must read it from here, not keep its own
hardcoded copy. Update it in exactly one place when a real detail changes.

There is deliberately only ONE phone/WhatsApp number and ONE general
support email. EduTrellis does not have a separate sales line, toll-free
number, or a second support address — do not add one here without it
being genuinely true, since anything added here is treated as
authoritative and handed straight to the AI model as fact.
